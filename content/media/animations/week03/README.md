# Week 3 Animation Sandbox

This folder tracks the Manim scenes validated during Week 3. Actual MP4 exports
are generated in Week 4 once storyboards are signed off.

## Render log template

```
| Date | Scene | Command | Notes |

Populate the table above as scenes are rendered. Commit only the README and
scene source files; large media outputs stay out of the repository.
