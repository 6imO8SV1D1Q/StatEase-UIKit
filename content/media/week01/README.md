# Week 1 Media Assets (Placeholder)

StatEase UIKit stores descriptive statistics lesson figures outside of the Git
repository so we can keep pull requests text-only. This folder documents the
expected assets and filenames for Week 1.

## Expected PNG exports

| Asset name | Description | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| `mean_basic_fig01.png` | Arithmetic mean illustration (intro) | Upload to shared design drive under `StatEase/UIKit/Week01` |
| `mean_basic_fig02.png` | Step-by-step mean calculation | Same location as above |
| `variance_basic_fig01.png` | Conceptual variance spread diagram | Same location as above |
| `variance_basic_fig02.png` | Worked variance example chart | Same location as above |
| `std_deviation_basic_fig01.png` | Standard deviation bell curve overview | Same location as above |
| `std_deviation_basic_fig02.png` | Deviation from mean visual | Same location as above |
| `sample_placeholder.png` | Generic placeholder for QA | Optional; use when UI needs non-final art |

When preparing an application bundle, download the latest PNGs from the design
share and drop them into this directory. Asset filenames must remain identical
so that lesson JSON `media.asset_name` references resolve without additional
code changes.
